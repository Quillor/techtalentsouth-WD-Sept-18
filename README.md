# Introduction to web design

## Naming your files:
- Always use lowercase
- Don't use spaces
- If you need a space, add a - like-this.html  
- For the "homepage" file, call it `index.html`
- At the end of your filename, include the file type. Example `file.html` or `file.css`


## Head
- The head tag is for information that the browser needs to help Google Search and Social Media Share previews

```HTML
<head>
  <title>My First Website</title>
  <meta name="description"  content="Some quick description about my website. 150-160 characters long" />
  <meta charset="UTF-8"/>
</head>
```
- **Title**: Title of the page, used in Google Search
- **Meta description**: Used in Google Search preview text and social share text.
- **Charset**: Tells the browser about special characters like quotes, copyright symbols and non-English letters. 


```HTML
<h1>Title</h1>

```
